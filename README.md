# Sprint Challenge: Advanced CSS and Intro to JavaScript - Influential Artists

**Read these instructions carefully. Understand exactly what is expected _before_ starting this Sprint Challenge.**

This challenge allows you to practice the concepts and techniques learned over the past week and apply them in a concrete project. This Sprint explored advanced CSS and introductory JavaScript concepts. During this Sprint, you studied responsive web design, variable declaration, conditionals, loops, functions, arrays, and objects. In your challenge this week, you will demonstrate proficiency by creating a website of influential artists with data from an object.

This is an individual assessment. All work must be your own. Your challenge score is a measure of your ability to work independently using the material covered through this sprint. You need to demonstrate proficiency in the concepts and objectives introduced and practiced in preceding days.

You are not allowed to collaborate during the Sprint Challenge. Your work reflects your proficiency in Responsive Design, and JavaScript Basics.


## Introduction

In this challenge, you will use a data set of artists to build an "influential artists" webpage. This data comes from a set of "50 influential artists" on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ikarus777/best-artworks-of-all-time). We have reduced the data to just 20 artists to make it slightly easier to work with. You are free to work with the full data set as a stretch goal.

### Commits

Commit your code regularly and meaningfully. 

## Interview Questions
### (please edit this file and write your answer below each question. In addition, you may also review these questions with your mentor)

Please answer the following questions below, you may edit the readme file to include your answers below the question.

1. How would you describe acessibility on the web to someone new to programming?

    Acessibiltity on the web is crucial.  It allows EVERYONE to use and navigate websites.  It ensures that webpages account for a range of dissabilities,
    and provide a user friendly experience for all.  It ensures that users who require screen readers / have visual impairments (etc) are able to navigate
    the webpage and use the webpage in a similar manner to those who do not have these dissabilities.

2. Talk about 3 different things you can do to ensure your website is accessible. 

    2a. Use scalable units.  This accounts for different screen sizes, and will allow font to be re-sizable.
    2b. Use alt text with images.  If a picture doesn't load the alt text will.  This helps convey what the image is to both users with slower internet connections
    and those using a screen reader.
    2c. Use semantic HTML.  Semantic HTML provides a much more streamlined experience for users using a screen reader.  It provides much greater meaning to the user
    and to search engines.

3. How would you explain the concept of a variable to someone new to programming?

    A variable is a symbol that acts as a pointer to a value.  When you create a variable you can point this variable to a value to give it meaning.
    When you use this variable in code, you can substitute the variable for the value it's pointing at.

4. What is the purpose of using functions in code?

    Functions in code allow us to keep our code DRY.  It gives developers the flexability to re-use certain lines of code over and over without having to type them out
    multiple times.

You are expected to be able to answer questions in these areas. Your responses contribute to your Sprint Challenge grade. 

## Instructions

### Task 1: Project Set-Up

Follow these steps to set up your project:

1. Fork the repo
2. Clone your forked version of the repo
3. cd into your repo and create a branch with your first and last name
NOTE: Tests will run for the JavaScript portion of this challenge only
4. open the terminal in your vs code and type `npm install`
5. next type `npm run test:watch` in your terminal
6. Complete your work making regular commits, once you have all your tests passing and you are ready to submit your work please see canvas for instructions on how to submit

### Task 2a:  Minimum Viable Product - Responsive Design

*Before you jump in, take 10 minutes to review the code that has already been provided for you. Take time to see how the home page was built. During this time, [Review the provided design files](design/). You have been provided all content necessary in the [index.html file](index.html) and basic styling in the [index.css file](css/index.css).*

* [X] Add a viewport meta tag to the head of your index.html page.
* [X] Add responsive breakpoints to your code for 500px such that your styles match the [mobile design file](design/Mobile.png).

### Task 2b: Minimum Viable Product - JavaScript

Navigate to `index.js` and complete the MVP challenges. Note that you need to scroll past data (or collapse data in VScode) to find the challenges below.

### Task 3: Stretch Problems

After finishing your required elements, you can push your work further. These goals may or may not be things you have learned in this module but they build on the material you just studied. Time allowing, stretch your limits and see if you can deliver on the following optional goals:

* [ ] Website is responsive at multiple breakpoints and looks good in-between breakpoints because student is using responsive units of measurement where appropriate. Student is using most semantic HTML for each element on page and has included ARIA roles where applicable (More research may be required to implement ARIA roles)  
* [ ] Student demonstrates and can explain a deep understanding of basic programming concepts when walking Team Lead through the explanation of their code.
* [ ] Use advanced array methods (.map, .reduce, .filer) to refactor your MVP code (create an array of all artists born in the 1900s with .filter, for example) - do this seperate from your MVP tasks
